### Programmer

    Hi, my name is Minh Duong, and I am currently studying Computer Science at UC San Diego.

As a programmer, I have learned **3** programming languages so far:
  - C++ (intermediate)
  - Java (intermediate)
  - Python (beginning)

I know that there are many fields for Computer Science to work on, such as: 
1. Backend
2. Frontend
3. Fullstack
4. Web developer
5. Cyber Security
6. Software Developer
7. etc

I am currently interested in Game Developer because simply I love playing video games. 

***Goal***

> As a programmer, I need to know as much language as possible in order to be flexible in the work. Therefore, I want to set a goal to learn some more programming language until the end of the year:

        Python (most popular programming language)
        MATHLAB (need for Math course)
        C# (helpful for game developer)
        Javascript (if I want to switch to front-end or full-stack)
